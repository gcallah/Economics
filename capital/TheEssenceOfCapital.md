# What Is the Essence of Capital?

## Introduction

Alasdair MacIntyre is a very important contemporary moral philosopher, whose works have fundamentally
transformed my own understanding of morality. But recognizing his brilliance does not imply accepting all of his
conclusions without examination. In particular, my essay suggests that MacIntyre's embrace of certain propositions of
Karl Marx on economics exhibit a naive level of economic analysis, particularly disappointing in a thinker who claims he
is striving to understand the "essence" of economic phenomena.

## MacIntyre's Understanding of Capital

MacIntyre contends, following Marx, that "neither capitalists nor productive workers were able to recognize that capital
is 'unpaid labor'" (2016: 95). As such, "There must... be a class of owners of the means of production – land, tools,
machines, raw materials – who as employers pay out... wages that are sufficient to sustain the needed labor
force in being, but that are less than the value that those workers produce. That surplus value is appropriated by the
employers, for their own economic purposes" (2016: 97).

I do not wish, for a moment, to deny that there are many historical circumstances in which employers have been able to
exploit their workers and harness more than their fair share of the outcome of workers' labor. When and where that has
been, the case is an empirical question. But I do contend that McIntyre's essentialist analysis of the relationship
of capital to labor is seriously misguided, and that an Aristotelean approach to these topics, wich MacIntyre ought to
have adopted, demonstrates that fact.

## The Genesis of Capital

So what is "capital," and where does it come from? Of course, anyone may offer any definition of any term he may choose,
and definitions are never wrong, only more or less useful. But I suggest that there is a very useful definition of
"capital" that does help us get at the essence of a fundamental economic reality: "capital" is whatever goods a person,
family, community, tribe, society, or nation might possess that enable it to produce some "consumer" goods at some future time.
For example, if I personally own a blender, that will enable me to produce smoothies in the future. If my community has
shared athletic fields, it is more likely to give birth to star athletes down the road.

Now let us look at how capital goods come into being. Following the great Aristotelean-Austrian economist Carl Menger,
we will look to the simplest of situations involving the birth of capital goods, in order to get at their essence.

As Menger described his procedure, so we will proceed:

"In what follows I have endeavored to reduce the complex phenomena of human economic activity to the simplest elements
that can still be subjected to accurate observation . . . [and] to investigate the manner in which the more complex
phenomena evolve from their elements according to definite principles." -- Menger, Principles

So let us go to the "simplest elements" and consider Alasdair MacIntyre stranded by himself on a tropical island.
Each day, he goes down to the beach and tries to catch some fish. One day it occurs to him that, if he can build some
sort of net, he could catch more fish than he can by hand.

Since in each day's work he has been able to catch more than enough fish to survive, he decides to spend part of each
day building a net out of coconut fibers. The net he fashions becomes a capital good, since it is part of a plan to
produce more consumer goods (fish) in the future.

Once Alasdair has produced this net, he is in possesion of a capital good, but it would obviously be ridiculous to claim
that he had "exploited" anyone to come into possesion of it.
