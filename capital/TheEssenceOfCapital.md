# What Is the Essence of Capital?

## Introduction

Alasdair MacIntyre is a tremendously important contemporary moral philosopher, whose works have fundamentally
transformed my own understanding of morality. But recognizing his brilliance does not imply accepting all of his
conclusions without examination. In particular, this paper suggests that MacIntyre's embrace of certain propositions of
Karl Marx on economics exhibit a naive level of economic analysis, particularly disappointing in a thinker who claims he
is striving to understand the "essence" of economic phenomena.

## MacIntyre's Understanding of Capital

MacIntyre contends, following Marx, that "neither capitalists nor productive workers were able to recognize that capital
is 'unpaid labor'" (2016: 95). As such, "There must... be a class of owners of the means of production – land, tools,
machines, raw materials – who as employers pay out... wages that are sufficient to sustain the needed labor
force in being, but that are less than the value that those workers produce. That surplus value is appropriated by the
employers, for their own economic purposes" (2016: 97).

I do not wish, for a moment, to deny that there are many historical circumstances in which employers have been able to
exploit their workers and harness more than their fair share of the outcome of workers' labor. When and where that has
been, the case is an empirical question. But I do contend that McIntyre's essentialist analysis of the relationship
of capital to labor is seriously misguided, and that an Aristotelean approach to these topics, wich MacIntyre ought to
have adopted, demonstrates that fact.

## The Genesis of Capital

So what is "capital," and where does it come from? Of course, anyone may offer any definition of any term he may choose,
and definitions are never wrong, only more or less useful. But I suggest that there is a very useful definition of
"capital" that does help us get at the essence of a fundamental economic reality: "capital" is whatever goods a person,
family, community, tribe, society, or nation might possess that enable an increased amount of "consumer" goods at some future time.
For example, if I personally own a blender, that will enable me to produce smoothies in the future. If my community has
shared athletic fields, it is more likely to give birth to star athletes down the road.
